This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 error: accessing properties of a null object reference within an event handler. The `bug.as` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.as` provides a corrected version that handles the potential null reference.  The error occurs when an event handler attempts to access properties of the `event.target` object before checking for null.
